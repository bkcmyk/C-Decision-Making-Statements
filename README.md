Objective:
1. To write a C++ program that performs the following:
2. Checks whether a number is even or odd
3. Checks whether a character is a vowel or consonant
4. Determines the largest number among three user-entered integers

Theory:
1. Even or Odd Check
Uses the modulus operator % to check divisibility by 2.
If a number is divisible by 2, it is even; otherwise, it is odd.

2. Vowel or Consonant Check
Uses if condition to compare the character with both uppercase and lowercase vowels.
If the character matches any vowel, it is a vowel; otherwise, it is a consonant.

3. Finding the Largest of Three Numbers
Uses nested if and else if conditions to compare three numbers (x, y, z).
Prints the number which is greater than the other two.

Key Concepts Used:
Conditional Statements (if, else, else if)

Relational Operators (>, %, ==)

Logical Operators (||)

Standard Input/Output using cin and cout
